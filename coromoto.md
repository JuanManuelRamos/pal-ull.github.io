Coromoto Le√≥n obtained the degree in Mathematical Sciences in 1990. 
In 1992 she reads the thesis and obtain the PhD in Computer Science in 1996. 
In hers thesis contributions are made to the design of new sentences for the programming languages that allow
the expression of parallelism and the problems that arise when writing your translations for both a 
compiler and an interpreter. 
During this period she participates as collaborating researcher in projects financed by 
the Government of the Canary Islands. 
In 1998 she carried out a three-month postdoctoral stay at the 
EPCC - Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center under the TRACS program. 
As a member of the research team of the projects TIC99-0754-C03-01 and MaLLBa (TIC99-0754-C03-01), 
she discusses the parallelization of algorithmic divide and conquer and branch and bound techniques 
that she completes in two postdoctoral stays of one month and half each in EPCC in the years 2001 and 2002. 
In 2002, she began her responsibility as coordinator of the research team of the University of La Laguna, 
in the coordinated project of the Ministry of Education and Science TRACER (TIC2002-04498- C05-05) 
which addresses the study of efficient and flexible algorithmic techniques that allow users to focus 
solely on the problem they wish to solve, avoiding having to enter areas other than their domain. 
In the coordinated project Optimization and network environment - OPLINK (TIN2005-08818-C04-04), 
the main objective is to improve the results of communication problems. 
In MSTAR (TIN2008-06491-C04-02) the possibility of undertaking the resolution of a problem directly 
as a multi-objective is introduced. 
The agglutination of the resolution of multiple optimization problems with parallel techniques 
and their possible generalization has been the main objective of the TOP project (TIN2011-25448). 
She is currently in charge of the TOMAS project (TIN2016-78410-R) where meta-heuristic optimization 
techniques are applied to the planning of dietary menus. 
She has also collaborated in three projects for the acquisition of infrastructure that allows 
the work team to perform Computation of High performance in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. 
Thus, she has participated in fifteen research projects, being a collaborator in six and a 
responsible researcher in nine. 
She has directed six doctoral theses, two with European mention (years 2009 and 2012) and 
three with international mention (years 2012, 2014 and 2017) the four penultimate in the framework 
of a doctoral program with a Quality Award. 
Three of them have received the extraordinary doctorate prize in the Architecture and Engineering 
Knowledge Branch of the ULL. 
At this stage of her research, she has published more than twenty articles in journals and more 
than fifty documents in the proceedings of international conferences. 
In the transfer section of the MaLLBa and METCO research, the software tools developed as results 
of the research projects are distributed under a GNU public license. 
In 2009, a collaboration agreement was established with AEMET to parallelize HYSPLIT. 
The rest of the work with companies has been carried out under educational cooperation agreements.
